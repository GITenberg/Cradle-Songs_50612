A SONG OF SIX-PENCE.


    Sing a song, a brand new song:
    “Sing a song of six-pence,
      A pock-et full of rye.”
    John and Jim-my both picked some,
      So they could have a pie.

    And when they’d filled their pock-ets full,
      Down in the field of rye,
    They found some cun-ning lit-tle birds,
      To put in-to the pie.
    Six pret-ty lit-tle hid-den nests,
      Down in the yel-low rye,
    Held four-and-twen-ty ba-by birds,
      E-nough to fill the pie.

    They set them all with-in the dish,
      Lined with a crust of rye;
    But soon the four-and-twen-ty birds
      Cried out in-side the pie.

    Then Jim-my turned and looked at John,

[Illustration]

      And John took up the pie,
    And back the lit-tle lad-dies went
      In-to the field of rye.

    The moth-er bird flew up and shrieked,
      “O, have you baked that pie?
    How can you bring the cru-el dish,
      And eat it in the rye!” John--

      And soon they ate the pie;
    The birds flew out and found their nests
      Down in the yel-low rye.




PAYING BACK.


    Seven happy little chicks walked out one day in June,
    Thought they would enjoy the way by starting up a tune;
    Seven ugly little ducks, whose names I will not mention,
    Made up their minds to follow them, and spoil their good
          intention;
    Now everybody knows that a duckling’s voice is deep,
    And everybody knows that _quack_ will make more noise than
          _peep_.

[Illustration]

    So when they found their music drowned, these plucky little chicks
    Made up _their_ minds to cure these ducks of all such naughty
          tricks;
    So they chased them from the barn-yard, on this pleasant day in
          June,
    Then started on their walk again, and went on with their tune.
                                                            --_J. S._




THE GENEROUS CLOVER.


    Clover, clover in the field,
      Why do you hang your head?
    Have you done anything unkind?
      Or any cross word said?

    O no, my little maiden, no!
      I only droop with dew;
    And from my lips sweet honey drips;
      Come, I will share with you.
                              --_C. C. B._




WHERE THEY GROW.


    Down in the valley, deep, deep, deep,
    Where little sunbeams wink and peep,
    Under the grasses hiding low--
    There’s where the dear little violets grow.

    Out in the meadow, bright, bright, bright,
    Close by the clovers red and white--
    With heart of gold and a fringe of snow,
    There’s where the dear little daisies grow.

    Up in the older tree, tree, tree,
    Peep, and a tiny nest you’ll see,
    Swung by the breezes to and fro--
    There’s where the dear little birdlings grow.

    Up in the nursery, neat, neat, neat,
    Hear the patter of wee, wee feet--
    Hear little voices chirp and crow--
    There’s where the dear little babies grow!




BA-BY FAY FERN-Y.


    What is this, with blue
    Lit-tle shoes, so new--
    Cun-ning lit-tle feet,
    Trot-ting down the street,
    What will mam-ma say?
    Ba-by’s run a-way--
        Ba-by Fay Fer-ny.

    Calls a boy: “Hal-loo!
    See here, lit-tle pop-pet show,
    Come with me!” No, no,
    Ba-by’s do-in’ do
    Ba-by’s own self! Fast
    Round the cor-ner passed
        Ba-by Fay Fer-ny.

[Illustration: BA-BY FAY FER-NY.]

    Stops a great big man
    Hur-ry-ing all he can:
    “Here! what’s this! My!
    Dropped down from the sky?
    Some-bod-y’s to blame!
    Ba-by, what’s your name?”
        “Ba-by Fay Fer-ny.”

    “Where you go-ing? say!”
    “Day-day.” “What’s that, hey?
    See the ba-by fidg-et!
    What d’you want, you midg-et.”
    “Piece o’but-ter-bed,
    Su-gy on it, ’las-ses on it,
    Jam on it,” said
        Ba-by Fay Fer-ny.

    Peo-ple pause to see:
    La-dies, one, two, three;
    A po-lice-man, too;
    But no one that knew
    Whence the ba-by came.
    “What’s your pa-pa’s name?”
        “Pa-pa Fay Fer-ny.”

    Comes a breath-less maid:
    “O dear! I’m a-fraid
    Ba-by’s lost and gone--
    Ba-by Fer-gu-son!
    No--there down the street!
    O, you naugh-ty sweet
        Ba-by Fay Fer-ny!”




THE DOUGH-DOG.


    One day when grandma was making some pies,
    She wished to give Tommy a pleasant surprise;
    So she made a puppy-dog out of some dough,
    And baked it, and marked it, and named it Bruno.
    This wonderful dog could stand on its feet,

[Illustration: BRUNO.]

    Its body was chubby, and cunning and neat,
    Its little dough-head was spotted with black,
    And its little dough-tail curled over its back.
    And when Tommy saw it he shouted with glee,
    “How good grandma was to make that for me!”
    And he played with the puppy-dog day after day,
    Till its head and its tail were both worn away.
                          --_M. E. N. H._




THE LION’S O-PIN-ION OF HIM-SELF.


    A li-on gazed down at his shad-ow one day;
    Said he, “I look fierce, I de-clare!
    No won-der my neigh-bors keep out of my way,
    And wish they were birds of the air!

[Illustration]

    “And I own that real-ly I feel a-fraid
    Some-times when I hear my-self roar!”
    And he wished as he went and lay down in the shade
    That he need be a li-on no more.




WHICH IS TALL-EST.


    Look! how they meas-ure,
      Dai-sy and Rose;
    Naught-y Dai-sy _will_ stand
      On the tips of her toes!

    If I was in her place
      I’d try to act fair!
    And Rose _is_ the tall-est
      For all, I de-clare!

[Illustration]




THE ANX-IOUS DOG-GY.


    Take care, lit-tle mas-ter,
      Or you’ll fall in!
    That wa-ter is up
      To your ver-y chin.

    Please don’t! please don’t,
      My mas-ter dear--
    O, I wish your moth-er
      Wouldn’t send you here!

    For oh! lit-tle mas-ter,
      What could I do,
    If you should fall in,
      But jump in too?

NINE LITTLE BIRDIES.


    Nine little birdies rocked by the breeze:
    First birdie said, “I’m tired of these trees;”
    Next birdie said, “Where shall we go?”
    Third birdie said, “Where red cherries grow!”
    Fourth birdie said, “Are they ripe, do you think?”
    Fifth birdie laughed with a rogue’s own wink;
    Sixth birdie said, “I’m sure that they are;”
    Seventh birdie said, “Is it very far?”
    Eighth birdie said, “Who’ll leader be?”
    Ninth birdie said, “I’m off, follow me!”
    Whew! Whew!
    And away they all flew
    Into Mr. John Lee’s
    Choice cherry trees!

[Illustration]




WHAT BA-BY DID.


    What do you think the ba-by did?
    Why, Ba-by did as he was bid!

    The dar-ling took a pen, and wrote--
    A lit-tle in-vi-ta-tion note,

    To all the aunts, and grand-mam-ma,
    To un-cles all, and grand-pa-pa,

    To all the ba-by kin ar-ray,
    To come to din-ner Christ-mas Day.

[Illustration: HE WRITES IT.]

    He wrote it ver-y black and plain,
    Criss-crossed and marked it all a-gain;

[Illustration: HE MAILS IT.]

    And though he had not had his nap
    He next was seen in cloak and cap,

    And go-ing up the crowd-ed street,
    Safe in his hand the mis-sive sweet,

    To drop it in the box him-self,
    The aw-ful lit-tle dar-ling elf!




TWO KIND LIT-TLE GIRLS.


    Whith-er a-way,
    Lit-tle la-dies so gay?
    “O, o-ver the hill
    To Grand-moth-er Dill!”
    And what have you there
    In your bas-ket square?
    “O, pud-dings and pies,
    A lit-tle sur-prise!”
    Why such good-will
    To Grand-moth-er Dill?
    “O, ev-er-y one should
    On Christ-mas do good!”
    Lit-tle maids, good day!
    Flow-ers strew your way!

[Illustration]




AN APRIL RAIN.


    You poor little birds,
      It’s happened again--
    In the midst of your play
      Down patters the rain.

    You were caught in a shower
      Just so last week,
    And I thought that morning
      I ought to speak;

    I hear you all up
      A-singing at dawn,
    I know you have tried
      Each tree on the lawn,

    Yet not one of you all
      Have picked up a straw--
    Such improvident birds
      I ne’er before saw.

    But I hope you see now
      That it would be best
    To let your play go
      And build you a nest.

[Illustration]




WHAT THE GRASSES SAID.


    Who can hear the grass talk?
      Very few, I know;
    Yet it whispers every day,
      Sweet and soft and low.

    And one day I heard it;
      Shall I tell you when?
    I lay on the grass to read,
      And I heard it then.

    Everything was pleasant;
      Bright the sun did shine;
    Dew lay in the flowers’ eyes,
      Heavy sleep in mine;

    So I gently shut them;
      Soon they opened wide;
    For I heard the grasses talk
      Fast on every side!

    This is what they talked about:
      “Oh, what pleasant weather!
    Lift your heads up to the sun,
      Nod and wave together!

    “We’re so glad that we are grass,
      Cool and soft and green;
    Oh, how sad the earth would look
      If no grass were seen!

[Illustration]

    “And we love the summer warm,
      But, oh, dear! oh, dear!
    What will little grasses do
      When winter cold is here?

    “How the wind will whistle
      Round about our heads!
    Oh it’s very hard to have
      No covers on our beds!”

    Then the wise red-rose bush
      Tall, and rough and old,
    Shook his head, and kindly said,
      “You will not be cold,

    “For God sends a blanket warm
      For every blade of grass,
    Soft and light, and white as wool;
      Not a blade He’ll pass!”

    “What’s the blanket made of?
      Quick! we want to know!”
    “Why, my dears,” the rose-bush said,
      “God’s blanket is the snow.”
                                --_J. S._




TAB-BY’S LULL-A-BY.


    Wash-wash-you-cat,
      Now this side, now that!
    Wash-wash-you-cat,
      Keep clean and grow fat!

    Four lit-tle ears,
      And eight lit-tle paws,
    Two small nos-es,
      And for-ty sharp claws,

    Give moth-er’s tongue
      A great deal to do.
    So hush! keep still,
      And I’ll sing to you:

    _Purr-r! purr-r!
      In a sil-ver house,
    Moth-er once saw
      A lit-tle white mouse,_

    _Soft white fur,
      And lit-tle pink eyes,
    So round and plump,
      And so ver-y wise._

    Wash-wash-you-cat,
      Now hold up your chin.

[Illustration]

    Me-ow! don’t you scratch--
      To scratch is a sin.

    Me-ow! Me-ow!
      You _bad_ lit-tle cat,
    You mustn’t bite;
      Moth-er won’t stand that!

    Purr-r! purr-r!
      Now shut up your eyes;
    Moth-er will make
      You some cat-nip pies.

    Purr-r! purr-r!
      Lit-tle balls of fur,
    Purr-r! purr-r!
      Lie still, and don’t stir.

    Wash-wash-you-cat,
      Lit-tle balls of fur!
    Wash-wash-you-cat,
      Purr-r! purr-r!




SOME NAUGHTY I’S.


      “I, I, I,”
    Some little people cry:
      “I won’t, I can’t,
      I shall, I shan’t--”
    Oh, what a naughty I;

      “I, I, I,”
    Now hear them passing by:
      “I han’t, I be,
      I are, I see--”
    Oh, what a naughty I.




AT BREAK-FAST.


    A gay lit-tle bird
      That want-ed some fun
    Flew in and light-ed
      On the ba-by’s bun.

    He pecked at a cur-rant,
      He sipped from the cup,
    Then hopped on the loaf,
      And thus piped up:

    “_Peep-sy weeps!_ Ba-by, say,
    What’ll you give if I will stay?
    _Peep-sy weeps!_ Ba-by, O,
    What’ll you give if I will go?”

[Illustration: AN AS-TON-ISHED BA-BY.]

    He splashed the milk,
      He nib-bled the bread,
    He spread both wings,
      He stood on his head.

    But still the ba-by
      Said nev-er a word--
    And out of the win-dow
      Flashed the bird!

    “_Peep-sy weeps!_” loud sang he,
    “Such a stu-pid ba-by I nev-er did see!
    Nev-er a smile, nev-er a word--
    _Peep-sy weeps!_ I’m glad I’m a bird!”




BA-BY DIM-PLE AT BREAK-FAST.


    She sits in the porch with her sau-cer;
      Smeared are her fin-gers and thumbs;
    While a-round with nois-y clat-ter
      Old hen, with her chick-ens comes.

    Ba-by shoos and shoos, and strikes them
      With the spoon that spills the crumbs:
    “_Do ’way chick-ies! ’ou s’an’t hab em--
      My nice bwead an’ las-ses tums!_”

    But the chick-ies sly will pick them
      When Miss Dim-ple’s not on the watch;
    And old moth-er hen comes bold-ly

[Illustration]

      With her mind made up for a snatch.
    Take care, Mrs. Hen-ny-pen-ny!
      One good rap is what you catch,
    With Miss Dim-ple’s sharp ad-vise-ment:
      “_’Ou la-zy ol’ fing--go scwatch!_”




NOBODY KNOWS.


    How the wind whistles and roars!
    How he blows, he blows, and he blows!
    But what does he say at the doors?
    Nobody knows, nobody knows.

    The ground is covered with white,
    For it snows, it snows, and it snows;
    But it falls so silent at night
    That nobody knows, nobody knows.

    The grass is springing again,
    And it grows, it grows, and it grows,
    In the sunshine and the rain--
    How, nobody knows, nobody knows.

    Hear the black cock flap his wings!
    And he crows, he crows, and he crows;
    But whether he laughs or he sings,
    Why, nobody knows, nobody knows.

    The brook runs sparkling along,
    And it flows, it flows, and it flows;
    But what is its rippling song,
    Why, nobody knows, nobody knows.

    The cow comes down through the lane,
    And she lows, she lows, and she lows;
    But what she says it is plain
    That nobody knows, nobody knows.

    Over the fields and away
    Fly the crows, the crows, the crows;
    They caw, they caw, but they say
    What nobody knows, nobody knows.
                            --_E. B._




THE LOST CHICKENS.


    “CLUCK, cluck! cluck, cluck!” called the mother-hen,
      “Some harm has come to my chickens, I fear;
    I counted this morning, and then there were ten;
      Now four are gone, and but six are here.”

[Illustration: “ALL SAFE AND SOUND.”]

    “Peep, peep! peep, peep!” four chickens replied,
      As they sipped the dew from a burdock leaf;
    “We must hurry back to our mother’s side,
      She is calling us now with a voice of grief.”

    Then away to her side they ran again,
      Leaving the dainty drink they had found;
    “Cluck, cluck! cluck, cluck!” said the mother-hen,
      “Here are my ten, all safe and sound.”
                        --_M. E. N. H._




LIKE BABY.


    I’m going to make a dolly,
      Just like the baby there;
    I’m going to take some sunshine
      And twist it up for hair.

    I’m going to take the bluest speck
      In all the great blue skies,
    And make a bright blue pretty pair
      Of little winking eyes.

    I’m going to take some roses,
      The sweetest, brightest pink,
    To make her little darling cheeks,
      The very thing, I think!

    But, oh dear me! I surely am
      Forgetting all the while,
    I cannot find a single thing
      To make baby’s smile.




HOW THE BABY WAS NAMED.


    Mother’s busy washing;
      Jack has gone to school;
    Baby’s in the garden;
      Kitty has a spool.

    Every one is busy
      This bright summer day,
    None more so than Baby,
      Working hard to play.

[Illustration]

    Hat stuck full of daisies,
      Dolls are daisy-crowned--
    Daisies, daisies everywhere
      Lying on the ground.

    Out comes little pussy
      Tossing them about;
    Baby calls, “Go way now!”
      With a little pout.

    Summer sun grows warmer;
      Baby tires with play;
    Down upon the green grass
      Fast asleep she lay;

    Daisies all about her,
      Sunshine overhead,
    Pussy nestled closely
      In this summer bed.

    Mother from her washing
      Comes, and finds her there
    With the wide-eyed daisies
      Nestling in her hair.

    Then was Baby christened
      In the summer sweet;
    Now, no longer “Baby,”
      But sweet Marguerite.




THE WINDOW-PANE TREE.


    With her warm little finger,
        Gold Locks wrote
    On the icy window-pane
        A note.

    “Make me a Christmas-tree,”
        It read;
    It was signed with a flourish,
        “Yours, Gold Head.”

    Then out came the sunlight’s
        Sparkling ray;
    It melted the message
        All away.

    But the very next morning,
        Lo! behold!
    On the glass of the window,
        White and cold,

    Was a tapering fir-tree,
        Weighed with snow,
    Spire-like at the top,
        And broad below.

    Cried out little Gold Locks,
        “See, oh, see!
    Jack Frost has painted
        My Christmas-tree!”

BIRDS IN WINTER.


    Come now, little birds,
      You must stop in your play,
    The snow’s coming down,
      You must hide you away.

    You must huddle together
      And keep yourselves warm,
    In snug nooks and corners
      Shut out from the storm.

    Be patient and wait,
      The clouds will go by,
    And sunshine once more
      Will brighten the sky.

    In the woods and the fields
      Where summer-plants grew,
    The buds and the seeds
      Are stored up for you.

    You can seek them for food
      When the weather is fair,
    And chirp your sweet songs
      In the clear pleasant air.




THREE TRAVELLERS.


    Three funny little travellers
      Set out to leave the town;
    And all they wore to keep them warm
      Was one white, ruffled gown.

    I asked these little travellers
      If far they meant to roam.
    “Oh, no,” they all together said;
      “We’ll not go far from home.”

    The first brave one who started out
      Was our sweet Baby May;
    She said, “I’m going to By-lo-Land,”
      In such a sleepy way.

    The second one, in gown of white,
      Was Alice, six years old;
    She said, “I go to Shutty-eye-town,”
      And on she went, both fast and bold.

    And Lottie, eldest one of all,
      Said, “On this road I plod,
    To 76, Old Blanket street,
      Bedfordshire, the Land of Nod.”

    I wondered where these towns could be,
      When mamma softly said,
    “Good night, good night, my children dear!
      Now hurry off to _bed_!”      --_J. S._




A TALE OF A BOT-TLE.


    A bot-tle of ink on the ta-ble,
      A lit-tle girl on the floor--
    And now I don’t think I’ll be a-ble
      To tell you an-y-thing more.

    The lit-tle girl up to the ta-ble,
      Mam-ma look-ing in at the door--
    And now I don’t think I’ll be a-ble
      To tell you an-y-thing more.

    The lit-tle girl runs from the ta-ble,
      Bot-tle rolls down to the floor--
    And now I don’t think I’ll be a-ble
      To tell you an-y-thing more.

    Then mam-ma runs up to the ta-ble,
      Lit-tle girl runs for the door--
    And now I don’t think I’ll be a-ble
      To tell you an-y-thing more.

[Illustration: A ROGUE.]

    Mam-ma runs a-way from the ta-ble,
      And catch-es the girl at the door--
    And now, oh! I _know_ I’m not a-ble
      To tell you an-y-thing more.




A WONDERFUL SCHOLAR.


      O, a wonderful scholar
        Is our little Kate!
    She reads in a primer;
      She writes on a slate;
    Her lines are not even;
      Her O’s are not round;
    And her words in the reader
      Could not be found.

      Her sewing--what puckers!
        What stitches! what knots!
    And along the whole hem,
      There are tiny red spots.
    Her weekly reports
      Tell how oft she has spoken;
    And there’s not a rule
      That she never has broken.

    [Illustration]

    Yet she comes to mamma
      For a smile and a kiss,
    As if a “bad mark,”
      Should be paid for by this.

    And she cries in delight,
      While she swings round her hat:
    “I’m a wonderful scholar,
      For I can spell ‘cat!’
                C-A-T, _Cat_!”
                              --_K. L._




OUT IN THE MEADOW.


    What do you think I saw to-day
    Out in the meadow bright,
    It tripped along on four little feet
    In a coat all woolly and white;

    I said “Good morning, you pretty thing!”
    And it raised its gentle head
    As if it wanted to chat awhile;
    But, “_Baa-Baa_,” was all it said!

    What do you think I led with me,
    Blue eyed, dimpled, and sweet?
    It hardly bent the daisies down
    With _two_ little toddling feet;

    She laughed and chattered at Woolly-back,
    She patted his little head;
    But he talked almost as well as she,
    For “_ma-ma_” was all _she_ said!

       *       *       *       *       *

Transcriber’s Notes:

_April Rain_, “thelawn” changed to “the lawn” (tree on the lawn)

_Tab-by’s Lull-a-by_, after comparing text to original poem in
“Babyland,” the word “A” was added to start of line of poetry (A great
deal to do)

_Some Naughty I’s_, “NAUGHY” changed to “NAUGHTY” in poem’s title.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
